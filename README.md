# Thoughts 
the project is simple we work on some dataset and try to find out what are the trends and what is is the pattern 
after finding out the pattern one can get idea what do i have uploaded the dataset also you explore various dataset on laggle because this one i downloaded from there.
We first do EDA and I have writteen commnets for everything in the jupyter notebook you can refer it.
after that we checked for various algorithms which gave accuracy and precison score and which was having great score we used that.
then we trained the mode and pickled the model and used it.For the website pat I have used streamlit.
